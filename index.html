            <h2>Compassionate Individuals</h2>
            <p>"Caring Clowns for Souls", which is comprised of two very kind, compassionate individuals, Melody and Gary Roster, has proven to be one of the best assets for our organization that I have encountered in a long time. "Nurse Freckles" and
                "Dr. Dew Rite" visit our hospice patients on a regular basis to bring smiles to their faces.</p>

            <h2>A Memorable Treat</h2>
            <p>One particular patient received an extra helping of caring and compassion when Melody and Gary helped the patient become a clown for a day and assist them with their clown visits. What a memorable treat for our patient! They also took
                pictures so the experience could be enjoyed for many days afterwards and shared with friends and our in-house staff.</p>

            <h2>A Caring Soul</h2>
            <p>To have such a talent to make others feel so good-if for only a short while-is amazing. To share that talent out of the goodness of your heart for those needing uplifting, so badly, is a tribute to faith and human kindness. As you can
                tell, I have nothing but the best of things to say about these clowns with "a caring soul".</p>
