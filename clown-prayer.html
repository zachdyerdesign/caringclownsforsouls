      <p class="lead">As I stumble through this life, help me to create more laughter than tears, dispense more cheer than gloom, spread more cheer than despair.</p>
      <p class="lead">Never left me become so indifferent, that I will fail to see the wonders in the eyes of a child, or the twinkle in eyes of the aged.</p>
      <p class="lead">Never let me forget that my total effort is to cheer people , make them happy, and forget mementarily, all the unpleasantness in their lives.</p>
      <p class="lead">And in my final moment, may I hear You whisper: "When you made My people smile, you made Me smile."</p>
